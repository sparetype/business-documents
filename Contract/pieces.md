What is the client responsible for? The client is responsible for two things and two things only: Content & Goals. This amounts to the information that you will have obtained through your questionnaire. These two things should be acquired before the start of that project and remain constants; they do not change.


This is a legal and binding contract between Your Name and the Client listed below.

Better to have it and not need it, than to need it and not have it.


I am really excited that we are at the stage where we sign contracts and I hope this document helps us maintain a great professional relationship. You should know I always do my best to fulfil Your needs and meet your expectations, but it’s important to have things written down so that we both know what’s what, who should do what and when, and what will happen if something goes wrong. All I want is clear communication and what’s best for both parties, now and in the future.


I’ll always do my best to fulfil your needs and meet your expectations, but it’s important to have things written down so that we both know what’s what, who should do what and when, and what will happen if something goes wrong. In this contract you won’t find any complicated legal terms or long passages of unreadable text. All I want is clear communication and what’s best for both parties, now and in the future.
