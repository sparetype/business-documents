_Let's get a few pronouns out of the way so things can be a little more conversational. I am not a fan of small print or legalese, so I aim to keep this document as concise and casual as possible._

"You" refers to [insert client/company name] located at [insert address]

"I" or "Me" refers to Griffin Shreves, III doing business as SpareType located at 425 Webster Road #220 Auburn, Alabama 36832

## Summary:

I’ll always do my best to fulfil your needs and meet your expectations, but it’s important to have things written down so that we both know what’s what, who should do what and when, and what will happen if something goes wrong. In this contract you won’t find any complicated legal terms or long passages of unreadable text. All I want is clear communication and what’s best for both parties, now and in the future.

So in short;

You are hiring Me to consult and work on various graphic design projects for the next year for the total price of $15,000. Of course it’s a little more complicated, but we’ll get to that.

## Scope of Work

Since there is a wide range of projects we could work on throughout the year, a separate Scope of Work document is supplementary to this contract and shall be referenced and referred to when agreeing and defining the project’s scope.

#### Changes to Scope of Work
There are times when the Scope of Work may need to change. If needed, we will handle these situations with face-to-face communication. Any major deviations in Scope of Work may require renegotiation of the duration of this contract, additional compensation, or the termination of this contract.

## Deadlines

Deadlines will be defined and agreed to as part of the Scope of Work. Deadlines work both ways. You agree to give Me everything I need, in the format I need it, to complete projects. You will review work, provide feedback, and approve completions in a timely manner. In return, I agree to provide regular updates on progress and complete work on time.

In the unfortunate event that either one of us cannot meet a deadline, it is important that we remain completely transparent and honest about any delays or hold ups. Delays can, will, and do happen. It is how we handle them that matters.
