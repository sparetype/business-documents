## Definitions
_Let's get a few pronouns out of the way so things can be a little more conversational. I am not a fan of small print or legalese, so I aim to keep this document as concise and casual as possible._

"You" refers to [insert client/company name] located at [insert address]

"I", "My", or "Me" refers to Griffin Shreves, III doing business as SpareType located at 425 Webster Road #220 Auburn, Alabama 36832

## Summary:
I’ll always do my best to fulfil your needs and meet your expectations, but it’s important to have things written down so that we both know what’s what, who should do what and when, and what will happen if something goes wrong. In this contract you won’t find any complicated legal terms or long passages of unreadable text. All I want is clear communication and what’s best for both parties, now and in the future.

So in short;

You are hiring Me to consult and work on various graphic design projects for the next year for the total price of $15,000. If only it were that simple.

## Scope of Work
Since there is a wide range of projects we could work on throughout the year, a separate Scope of Work document is supplementary to this contract and shall be referenced and referred to when agreeing and defining the project’s scope.

#### Changes to Scope of Work
There are times when the Scope of Work may need to change. If needed, we will handle these situations with face-to-face communication. Any major deviations in Scope of Work may require renegotiation of the duration of this contract, additional compensation, or the termination of this contract.

## Deadlines
Deadlines will be defined and agreed to as part of the Scope of Work. Deadlines work both ways. You agree to give Me everything I need, in the format I need it, to complete projects. You will review work, provide feedback, and approve completions in a timely manner. In return, I agree to provide regular updates on progress and complete work on time.

In the unfortunate event that either one of us cannot meet a deadline, it is important that we remain completely transparent and honest about any delays or hold ups. Delays can, will, and do happen. It is how we handle them that matters.

##  Copyright, intellectual property, and ownership
You guarantee that all elements of text, images, or other design materials You provide are either owned by You, or that You have permission to use them.

At the conclusion of this contract, all copyright and intellectual property rights for work produced are assigned to You with the following exceptions:

1. Any open source or other third-party resources used in a project will remain under their respective licenses and copyrights.
2. I retain all rights to certain generic design tools that might be used in creating projects. These might include code snippets, theme frameworks, icon sets, and other common design resources. Any generic design tools used in a project will be provided to You and are licensed to You royalty-free for future use.
3. I retain all rights to any preliminary draft concepts and artwork not used or related to the final outcome of the project.
4. I retain the right to display any portion of work in my portfolio and website for the purpose of self-promotion.

## Liability
I can’t guarantee that work will be error free - for example, typographical errors in material You provide and I do not catch before production or unreported bugs in website code. Any errors reported while under this contract or up to thirty days past the conclusion of this contract will be addressed and fixed in a manner You and I agree upon during face-to-face communication. I am not liable to You or any third-party for damages, including lost profits or other incidental damages, resulting from any errors.

## Other Legal Mumbo Jumbo
- You cannot transfer this contract to anyone else without My permission.
- If for some reason one part of this contract becomes invalid or unenforceable, the remaining parts of this contract remain in place.
- This contract is a legal document under exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Lee County, Alabama.

## Timeframe
This contract goes into effect on the date signed and remains in effect for 365 days.

## The Money
In addition to this signed contract and a fully agreed Scope of Work, a $1500 deposit is required to begin work. The remaining $13,500 will be invoiced to You in equally divided payments over the next 365 days on a [monthly,quarterly] basis. Invoices are to be paid within 15 days of being received, after which they are considered late. A 10% late fee will be charged and added to any outstanding invoice balances that become late.

#### Other Expenses
Depending on the Scope of Work, there are likely third-party expenses associated with producing a final product. These could include web hosting, e-commerce merchant fees, cost of printing, and other material costs. I will do my best to make You aware of these costs as early in the project as possible, but You are responsible for paying these production costs.
